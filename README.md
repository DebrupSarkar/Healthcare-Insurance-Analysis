# Healthcare-Insurance-Analysis
## Problem Overview
The escalating cost of healthcare has emerged as a pressing concern, affecting not just patients but also healthcare providers and insurance companies. Addressing this issue requires a thorough understanding of the elements that drive medical expenses, along with the ability to accurately forecast future healthcare spending through data-driven models.

## Project Goal
This project is centred on predicting healthcare costs for patients and uncovering the factors that influence those costs. Through the analysis of clinical, lifestyle, and demographic data, the project seeks to:
•	Detect patients who are likely to incur high medical expenses early in the process.
•	Provide valuable insights for health insurers to inform both long-term planning and day-to-day operations.
•	Reveal how various health indicators — such as BMI, heart issues, and HbA1C levels — interact and impact overall costs.
•	Enhance planning around resources, risk mitigation, and preventive healthcare programs.

## Practical Application
The outcomes of this analysis equip healthcare insurance companies with the tools to better segment patient risk, optimize pricing strategies, and implement targeted interventions to reduce unnecessary expenditures. These insights ultimately support improved patient care and promote the financial sustainability of healthcare systems.
